# Hex Parser
Intel Hex converter to binary.  

## How it works
Provide an Intel Hex file and an allocated buffer that represents the processor memory, and the parser will fill the buffer with the Hex file content.  
You get a buffer filled with the exact code contained in the Hex file, at the right addresses.
